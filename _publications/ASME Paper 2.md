collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ASME Paper 2
excerpt: 'The objective of this paper was to study the effect of multiple jet impingements on one another in a heat sink under adiabatic conditions. The jet impingement is a unique design which aimed to optimize the cooling performance of a concentrated photovoltaic cell.'
