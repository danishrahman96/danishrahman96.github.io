title: "Global Shaper - NYC Manhattan Hub as part of the World Economic Forum Global Shapers Community"
excerpt: "The [Global Shapers Initiative](https://www.globalshapers.org/) is a program started by the World Economic Forum to involve young people to address regional and global challenges. I am a member of the Global Shapers Community as part of the [New York City Manhattan Hub](https://www.globalshapers.org/hubs/nyc-manhattan-hub). As part of this inspiring community, I have been collaborating directly with local leaders on discourse regarding the [Battery Park City Resilience Projects](https://bpca.ny.gov/nature-and-sustainability/resiliency/), an active coastal protection project to protect southern Manhattan from the threat of storm surges and rising sea levels. <br/><br/><img src='/images/GlobalShapers1.JPG'>"
