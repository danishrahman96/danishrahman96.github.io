title: "Presenter at inaugural Global Shapers Community Caribbean Retreat"
excerpt: "I attended and presented at the inaugural Global Shapers Community Caribbean Retreat, organized by the [Global Shapers Port of Spain Hub](https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-shapers-port-of-spain-hub/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BGbFQV9Y1SCqQGNL%2FzYilzQ%3D%3D) in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago in September 2023. The conference was centered around the increased environmental impact in the Caribbean and its associated challenges, caused by unprecedented climate change. I was honored to present on the benefits and advantages of utilizing indigenous construction and building practices, human-centered design and biomimicry, particularly when addressing areas where large-scale flooding is a frequent occurrence.
