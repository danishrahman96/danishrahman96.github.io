Hello, and welcome to my homepage! My name is Danish Rahman, and I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s Degree in Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in Robotics and Control Systems at Columbia University with expected graduation in December 2023. My research interests include autonomous robotics such as self-driving ground and aerial vehicles, rehabilitation robotics and the hardware-software intersection within these domains. Above all, I am keenly interested in how human beings and the surrounding environment continue to interact with these robotic systems. 

I completed my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering in 2018 from Texas A&M University. Upon my graduation, I spent four years as a System and Mechanical Engineer working on R&D in offroad and electrified autonomous vehicles. This experience fostered my burgeoning passion for autonomous systems, while my time as a System Engineer facilitated my transition towards a higher-level design and architecture oriented approach.

Current Research Projects
======
Since beginning my Master's at Columbia University, I have been working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Robotics and Rehabilitation Lab (ROAR)](https://roar.me.columbia.edu/). At the ROAR Lab, I am working on the [Mobile Tethered Pelvis Assist Device (mTPAD)](https://roar.me.columbia.edu/content/mTPAD), a mobile gait training robotic system, which uses perturbation-based training to augment motion stability in elderly people, along with patients of degenerative illnesses such as Parkinson's and cerebellar ataxia.
