As part of a diverse team, I was responsible for the engineering design process for the aluminium chassis, outer fiberglass molded body shell, and interfacing the vehicleâ€™s electronics safely. Additionally, I was involved in the development and simulation of the vehicle's Ackermann steering and powertrain subsystems.
