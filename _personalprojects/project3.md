title: "Topology Optimization"
excerpt: "As part of an assignment for Dr. Hod Lipson's Digital Manufacturing course at Columbia University, I designed and 3-D modeled a desk and chair, before conducting topology optimization to reduce its mass while maintaining its performance requirements."

The desk has two legs and a 30 by 24 inch table-top. The estimated distributed load at the top of the desk is 1200 N (120 kg). The optimization process began with a single block, upon which the required load and reaction forces were applied using SolidWorks simulation. The optimized table is shown below.

The load estimation for the chair was done using three different loads. At the seat, a maximum load of 1500 N is considered. This means that an individual weighing up to 150 kg can sit on the chair. For the backrest, an estimated load of 500 N (50 kg) is considered. And finally, for the armrests, a maximum load of 100 N (10 kg) is considerd.
