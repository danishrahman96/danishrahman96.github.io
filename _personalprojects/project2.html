title: "SAE Supermileage Fuel-Efficient Vehicle"
excerpt: "I was a Founding Member of the TAMU-Q SAE Supermileage Team, with the aim to develop a fuel-efficient three-wheeled vehicle prototype for the SAE Supermileage 2018. As part of a diverse team, I was responsible for the engineering design process for the aluminium chassis, outer fiberglass molded body shell, and interfacing the vehicleâ€™s electronics safely. Additionally, I was involved in the development and simulation of the vehicle's Ackermann steering and powertrain subsystems. <br/><br/><img src='/images/Supermileage2.jpeg'>"
