title: "Quadrupedal Walking Robot"
excerpt: "I developed a quadrupedal robot as part of an engineering team project aimed at replicating the entire development cycle of a stand-alone engineering product. The process began from conceptual design, towards modeling in SolidWorks, self-procurement of electronic components such as microcontrollers and servo motors. Upon completion of initial simulation using SolidWorks, I 3D printed and laser cut the robot’s components and assembled the product.<br/><br/>Through a Linux and Python-based interface, I utilized parametric mapping and inverse kinematics to plan gait and motion trajectories for the Turtle-Bot. The outcome was not as expected, and to further optimize the motion, I replicated the robot’s 3D model and simulated the system using PyBullet. You can find an entertaining journey video below!
