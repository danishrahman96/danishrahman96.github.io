title: "Design and development of a hybrid cooling system for the thermal management of CPV solar cells"
excerpt: "Designed, fabricated and tested a prototype hybrid cooling system for solar cells, using varying air-water flow rates under adiabatic conditions. Testing was conducted for fluctuated air and water flow rates entering the test section from cross-flow and cell impingement interfaces, and two-phase flow regimes were identified through a high-speed camera. Through image-based analysis, the flow-rate ratio was tuned to observe the progression of critical flow regimes for optimal cooling efficiency.<br/><br/><img src='/images/Hybrid1.jpg'><br/><br/><img src='/images/Hybrid2.JPG'>"
