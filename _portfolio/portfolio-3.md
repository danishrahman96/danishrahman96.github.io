title: "Texas A&M University - Design and development of a hybrid cooling system for the thermal management of CPV solar cells"
excerpt: "Designed, fabricated and tested a prototype hybrid cooling system for solar cells, using varying air-water flow rates under adiabatic conditions. Testing was conducted to analyze the impact of two-phase flow regimes on the cooling efficiency in CPV cells. Through fluctuating air and water flow rates entering the test section from cross-flow and cell impingement interfaces, flow regimes were identified through visualization via a high-speed camera. From further image-based analysis, the flow-rate ratio was tuned to observe the progression of critical flow regimes for optimal cooling efficiency."
