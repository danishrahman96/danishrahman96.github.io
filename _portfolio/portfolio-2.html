title: "Rheinmetall Barzan Advanced Technologies - Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) R&D"
excerpt: "

I designed, prototyped and tested multiple subsystems, for a fleet of electrified semi-autonomous UGVs. Throughout my time on the project, I was involved in various aspects of the system. Initially, I was responsible for the integration and optimization of sensors such as LiDARs, EO/IR cameras and RADARs, along with troubleshooting of drivetrain and electrical subcomponents. This culminated in the development of a quasi-static UGV performance simulator on Simulink and an intensive characterization campaign to test vehicle performance in harsh climates and terrain. Simultaneously, I worked on verifying the hardware-agnosticity of the vehicle's Command and Control (C2) software, by developing a new proof-of-concept vehicle and integrating it with the C2. Upon completion, this led me to the more architectural and design-oriented role of System Engineer, where I was responsible for the definition of system requirements and architecture for the vehicles' relevant subsystems. This included vehicle and sensor performance requirements along with autonomous features such as waypoint navigation, target tracking and multi-UGV cluster mission planning and estimation.<br/><br/><img src='/images/UGV_final.JPG'>"
