title: "Rheinmetall Barzan Advanced Technologies - Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) R&D"
excerpt: "Developed a robust Command and Control (C2) software for a fleet of electrified UGVs. My contribution was divided into three main categories: autonomous features, embedded software features, and systems integration. Autonomy features included 3D-LiDAR-based collision avoidance and mission waypoint validation for autonomous navigation. Embedded software development included modular architecture design and implementation in C++. Lastly, system integration included sensor/actuator integration, testing, and characterization for functionality in harsh climate and terrain. <br/><br/><img src='/images/UGV_final.JPG'>"
